# Knight vs King Chess with Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract

In this project, an agent is trained to solve a chess-inspired puzzle game, where a knight must check the opponent king in the least amount of moves without being captured. To do this, we provide two approaches based on Reinforcement Learning, leveraging Deep Q-Networks and Actor-Critic approaches. We show that while both methods share similarities and significantly outperform a random baseline, they differ under more subtle aspects.
